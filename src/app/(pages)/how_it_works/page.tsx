                    Step 2: Understanding the Auctions
                </h3>
                <p>
                    HammerShift collaborates with Bring a Trailer (BaT) to bring
                    you live auction feeds. Users can browse through ongoing
                    auctions to select the ones they find most intriguing or
                    where they believe their knowledge of the market will give
                    them an edge in predictions.

                    Step 3: Making Predictions
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Once you&apos;ve selected an auction, it&apos;s time to
                    place your wager on the outcome. Predict the final selling
                    price based on your understanding of the car&apos;s value,
                    market trends, and past auction results. This isn&apos;t
                    just a guess; it&apos;s an informed prediction that tests
                    your knowledge and intuition.

                    Step 4: Watching the Auction
                </h3>
                <p>
                    As the auction progresses, you can watch in real time as
                    bids are placed. Engage with other members of the
                    HammerShift community through our live chat feature, discuss
                    strategies, and adjust your predictions as the auction
                    unfolds.

                    Step 5: Scoring and Rewards
                </h3>
                <p>
                    After the auction concludes, predictions are tallied and
                    winners are determined based on the accuracy of their
                    predictions. Points are awarded not just for accuracy but
                    also for the insight shown in your predictions. Accumulate
                    points to climb the leaderboards and earn rewards.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Whether you win or lose, each auction is a learning
                    opportunity. Review the outcomes and your predictions to
                    refine your strategy for future auctions. HammerShift offers
