                    How It Works:

                <ul className=" tw-list-disc tw-pl-5">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Join a Tournament:</strong> Start by selecting a
                        tournament with an entry fee (buy-in) that suits your
                        budget. Each tournament features a highlighted vehicle,
                        which serves as the main attraction.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Make Your Predictions:</strong> For each car in
                        the tournament, place your wager on what you think the
                        final selling price will be. Like a game of &quot;The
                        Price is Right,&quot; accuracy is key, so make your
                        guesses count!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Scoring System:</strong> After all cars in the
                        tournament have been sold, scores are calculated based
                        on how close each participant&apos;s predictions were to
                        the actual selling prices. The closer you are, the
                        higher your score!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Climb the Ranks:</strong> Perform well in
                        smaller tournaments to qualify for larger, more
                        prestigious competitions. As tournaments escalate, so do
                        the potential rewards and recognition within the
                        HammerShift community.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Win Prizes:</strong> Top-scoring participants
                        reap the rewards. Prizes range from cash payouts to
                        exclusive entries into high-stake tournaments with even
                        larger buy-ins and rewards.
