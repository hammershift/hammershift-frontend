                    &quot;Guess the Price&quot; â€“ a game of precision and
                    foresight that&apos;s all about the highest bid. Just like
                    the classic &apos;Price is Right&apos;, you have the chance
                    to wager on the final hammer price of coveted cars.
                    It&apos;s simple: study the car, place your wager, and if
                    your guess ranks among the top three closest to the final
                    sale price, you win a share of the prize pool. With your
                    automotive knowledge on the line, can you outbid the
                    competition and guess your way to victory?
